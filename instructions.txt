Tested with zig 0.6.0+4e63ca. The latest master branch build
from https://ziglang.org/download/ should work just fine.

zig build-exe basic-tcp-chat.zig
./basic-tcp-chat

This will print "listening at listening at 127.0.0.1:$PORT"
To play with it you have to open 2 terminal windows and in each one
(replacing $PORT with the one printed):

nc 127.0.0.1 $PORT

Now the terminals can talk to each other when you type your message and press enter.
